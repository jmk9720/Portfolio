# hw1q4.ipynb: Exploratory data analysis. Complete the Jupyter notebook titled hw1q4.ipynb posted on Brightspace.
# hw1q5.ipynb: Multivariate linear regression. In this exercise, will illustrate the use of multiple linear regression for calibrating robot control. The robot data for the lab is taken from TU Dortmundâ€™s Multiple Link Robot Arms Project. We will focus on predicting the current drawn into one of the joints as a function of the robot motion. Such models are essential in predicting the overall robot power consumption.
